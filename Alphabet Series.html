                    <p> Now we’re gonna hear a story with words which start with A.
                        A slant line here on the left, a slant line here on the right, and then across.
                        That is the uppercase A. A circle and then a line down like this.
                        That is lowercase a. Some words start with the letter A are apple, astronaut, Allosaurus.
                        We are gonna hear a story. Once upon a time, the astronaut had this Allosaurus dinosaur, and the Allosaurus turned into a spaceship.
                        Apple A was sitting in the spaceship. Then the astronaut went in the spaceship with still Apple A in it.
                        Then Apple A made the picture of outer space. Apple A went on the backseat. They went to Atlanta! The end.</p>

                       To make uppercase B, you do one line down, and then you do a small curve starting from the top,
                       and then you do a little bit bigger curve and going down to the bottom. And to make 
                       lowercase b, you do a line down, and then at the bottom you do a circle. 
                       Some words that start with the letter B are beaver, buffalo, bee. 
                       Okay now, here’s our story. Once upon a time, there was a beaver named Beverly. 
                       She was brown and had a blue belly. And her best friend, Bob the buffalo, was
                       going to a birthday party together. And they said, “How do we get there?” 
                       So, then they come up with an idea: they both could ride in a bubble. 
                       And then, they are riding in the bubble, and they’re about halfway 
                       there when the bubble bursts! And then the beaver says, “Our bubble burst. 
                       We have to fix it in time to get to the birthday party.” And then the buffalo says, 
                       “I have a great idea! We can get to the birthday party by you climbing on me, and I 
                       can run all the way there.” Then they get to the birthday party, and then they see a bunch of bees,
                       balloons, a birthday cake, which is banana flavored, and they see a banner that says, “Happy Birthday, 
                       Belle the Bee!” And then they say, “Wait! This is not the birthday party we have to go to.” 
                       And then, even though they’re at the wrong birthday party, Belle the bee realizes it, and she says, 
                       “It’s okay,” and they can stay and have cake. The end. </P>

                        To make lowercase c, you start here and make a smaller curve like this. Some words that start 
                        with the letter C are . . . camel, cat, crayons, cardboard. Okay, here’s our story. One time,
                        Carl the cute cat, who was creamy white and orange, and his best friend, Camilla the camel, 
                        were going to do a craft together, making colorful Christmas cards. So Carl was carrying the cardboard and crayons, 
                        but he was very clumsy. So he dropped them, and all the crayons and cardboard got crammed into a corner,
                        fell in the crack, and they couldn’t get them out. And that’s when Carl saw a castle outside the window.
                        So they climbed to the castle to get more crayons and cardboard. When they were done coloring, they got super-duper hungry,
                        so they decide to celebrate their crafts with some cheese and crackers. The end.</p>

                        Some things that start with D are . . . duck, dinosaur, doughnut. Okay, now here’s our story. 
                        Once there was a duck. His name was Doughy. He lived in a den. Doughy loved desserts, especially
                        doughnuts and danishes. One day, Doughy the duck discovered a door in his den he’d never seen before. 
                        As he stepped through, the door closed behind him. He couldn’t unlock it. It was very dark, but he could
                        see a dim light. When he found the light, he saw dinosaur. She was wearing a dress and was digging
                        in the dirt. Doughy said, “What are you doing?” And the dinosaur said, “Oh, hi. I’m Dorothy. I’m so hungry. 
                        I’m looking for dinner.” Doughy said, “Dinner’s not down there.” Then he gets an idea. 
                        “But if you help me get back to my den, I will help you get some dinner.” 
                        So, they went back to the door, and Dorothy the dinosaur had an idea. 
                        “We could use this diamond to drill through the door!” And it worked! 
                        Back in the den, they had dinner. Then they had lots of doughnuts and danishes for dessert. Delicious! The end. </p>

                        She used her phone to check her emails. She saw an email from her friend, Eli the Eagle. He’s sending email from 
                        the Empire State Building, where he’s working. There was an eclipse coming! It was gonna stop the electricity. 
                        He needed Esther’s help! So Esther back-flipped out of the elevator and eagerly bounced to the Empire State Building. 
                        She jumped from the Empire State Building aaaaaaaaaalll the way into space, where she can see Earth. 
                        And then she did eleven million flips to make a bunch of electricity that she took back to the Empire 
                        State Building and charged all the phones and computers so everyone can get their emails. The end. </p>

                        “Hmph. You’ll never make me laugh!” Then Freddy flipped over four times and pulled out a magic flower. 
                        He was going to use the magic flower to make Mr. Franklin laugh. He pushed a secret button in the flower, 
                        and instead of making Mr. Franklin laugh, it started a fire. “Oh no!” Freddy said. “We need a fire truck to put out the flames.”

                         “Okay, I’ll give you the golf balls.” He pulled and pulled, but the golf balls were glued on too tight.
                         He couldn’t do it! “Oh no!” Gary the goose said, “I have an idea! He flew up into the tree with his golf

                        Then she tried giving Hickey some hot dogs (her favorite), but Hickey wasn’t in the mood for hot dogs. And Hickey said, 
                        “Do you know any jokes? That might work.” But Hindi didn’t know any jokes. Hmm . . . So she went looking for something to tell Hickey. 
                        As she was walking past the hat store, she heard all sorts of funny jokes inside. And inside the hat store, 
                        she saw her friend Halley the horse. Hindi asked, “What are all these jokes I’m hearing?” Halley said, 
                        “Here, it’s this hilarious hat.” Hindi tried on the hilarious hat and the hat said, “Where do horses live? 
                        In NEIGH-borhoods!” Halley started laughing, ha ha ha ha ha, so Hindi bought the hilarious hat and went straight
                        to Hickey the hippopotamus’s house. Hickey was still sad, but then Hindi put on the hilarious hat, 
                        and Hickey heard the hilarious hat’s jokes and started laughing. Ha ha ha ha ha. Hickey the hippo said,
                        “Thank you so much, Hindi, for bringing this hilarious hat!” And everyone was really, really happy.
                        Now that Hickey was happy, Hickey and Hindi went next door to the ice cream shop,
                        where they had ice cream that was hay and honey flavored. The End. </p>

                        Itching powder is hard to ignore. They asked Izzy the impala, “Who do you think put itching powder down your back?” Immediately

                        Just then, an itty-bitty mouse showed up and admitted that he’d put itching powder down Izzy the impala’s back. 
                        Ian and Isaac apologized to Ingrid. “Ingrid, we didn’t mean to insult you. Our theory was incorrect.” Luckily,

                        by starting at the top and making a straight line down. 
                        But before you get to the bottom, make a curve like this. 
                        To make a lowercase j, you start about here in the middle.
                        You make a line down and a curve at the bottom.
                        Then you add a dot right on top. Some words that start with J are . . . Jellyfish. Jaguar. Jelly beans.
                        Okay, here’s our story. Once upon a time, there lived a jellyfish named Jenny. 
                        She loved jelly beans and had a jar full of them. But she couldn't open the jar. 
                        Her neighbor, Justine, was a jaguar who loved to jog, do jumping jacks, and juggle! 
                        When Justine the jaguar came by, Jenny the jellyfish jumped out of the water and said, 
                        “Justine! Will you please help me open this jar? It's full of jelly beans! I'll share them with you.
                        “ “I'm happy to help. All that jogging and jumping jacks and juggling made me the strongest jaguar in the jungle.
                        “ So, Justine opened the jar. “Thank you!“ said Jenny. “I would like to share these jellybeans with you.
                        “ “Thanks, but I don't like jelly beans,“ said Justine. “You don't have to eat them—you can juggle them!
                        “ “Ok that sounds great,“ said Justine. So Jenny the jellyfish gave Justine the jaguar enough jelly beans to juggle.
                        Justine would throw one back to Jenny when she jumped out of the water. They were so jolly, 
                        jumping and juggling and sharing the jelly beans. The End. </p>

                        you make a straight line down like this. And then, you make a slanted line here, 
                        and another slanted line here. To make a lowercase K, you make a straight line down, 
                        you make a smaller slanted line right here, and another slanted line right here. 
                        Some words that start with K are . . . Kangaroo. Koala. Kite. Okay, now, here’s our story. 
                        Once there was a kangaroo named Kevin who loved flying kites more than anything! 
                        He loved to fly kites so much, other kangaroos called him King of the Kites. 
                        One day, Kevin the kangaroo asked his friend Kayla the koala to fly kites with him. 
                        She said yes, and they went outside. They set up their kites and started to run. 
                        But there wasn’t any wind, so the kites wouldn’t fly! “There’s no wind!” Kevin said. 
                        “What should we do?” “I guess we’re just gonna have to wait for the wind,” 
                        said Kayla the koala. “I know! While we wait, I’ll play my kazoo, 
                        and you can practice your karate kicks.” “Great idea!” said Kevin the kangaroo. 
                        So Kayla played her kazoo and Kevin karate kicked to the music. 
                        Soon, all of the kangaroos and koalas came to see what Kayla and Kevin were doing. 
                        They were so impressed by their kazoo and karate kick show that they clapped and cheered and kicked. 
                        Suddenly, the cheering made a giant wind. “Keep cheering!” Kevin yelled. 
                        “And watch this!” Now that they had some wind, Kevin and Kayla grabbed their kites 
                        and ran and ran until the kites flew high in the air. 
                        Kevin did a karate kick while flying his kite. 
                        Now the animals clapped even more, and the kites flew even higher. 
                        “I might be the king of the kites, but your cheering was the key to helping me make the kites fly. 
                        Thank you for your help! You are all too kind!” Kevin said to his kingdom. 
                        “And thanks most of all to Kayla, who is a whiz on the kazoo.” The End.  </p>

                        You make a straight line down. Things that begin with L are . . . lion, lollipop, leopard, ladybug, Now here’s our story. 
                        There was a little lion named Lauren, and she lived by a log. She was playing tag with Lillian the ladybug. 
                        Lillian flew over the log where there were lollipops. And Lauren wanted to follow her, 
                        but she couldn’t jump over the log. Her legs were too little. 
                        Then Lappa the leopard came to help. And Lappa said, 
                        “Even though your legs are little, 
                        I can help you make them strong enough so you can leap over the log! Let’s practice leaping! 
                        First, leap over the leaf next to the log.” So Lauren the lion leapt over the leaf. 
                        Then Lappa said, “Now let’s try something bigger. 
                        Leap over the lizard.” When she leapt over the lizard, 
                        Lauren went even higher than before. “Your legs are getting stronger! 
                        Next,” Lappa said, “leap over the little llama.” 
                        So Lauren the lion leapt over the llama, that made her 
                        leap soooo high that she also leapt over the log. 
                        “All that leaping practice really worked! Thanks, Lappa!” 
                        Then Lauren got to play tag with Lillian the ladybug. 
                        And she got to eat a lemon lollipop! The End.</p>

                        and then they flied on a cloud, and they went all the way to space. 
                        Mary the monkey looked at the map. “It says next, we have to go to the moon.

                        And I’m SO hungry!” So they had mango cake on the cloud. 
                        And the mango cake tastes so good that they all got so much energy that 
                        they almost hopped over the moon. They really almost did. 
                        The moon was magical, and happened to be made out of milk. 
                        And then they got a big bottle of milk. And they took a big drink of their milk,

                        The neon newt suddenly woke up and was surprised to see a human. 
                        Then Nella the nurse said, “Hi, I’m a nurse and I can take care of you.” 
                        Nella the nurse placed him on a napkin to be treated. 
                        Afterwards, Nella the nurse offered nuggets to the neon newt. After nine days the wound healed. 
                        Then the newt said, “Thank you for taking great care of me.” 
                        “You’re welcome!” answered Nella the nurse. 
                        “We must celebrate! How about a costume party?” 
                        “Yes, great idea!” agreed the neon newt.

                        When they got to the next obstacle, Oscar the owl went OVER, and since Oliver 
                        the Ostrich had to do the opposite, he went UNDER. 
                        Finally, they came to the last obstacle, and Oscar said, “I’m going to go slooooooow,” and he was off. 
                        But, oh no! Oliver didn’t hear him, so he couldn’t figure out the right opposite. 
                        Oops! Ozzie the octopus saw that Oliver was stuck. 
                        “Oscar the owl is going SLOOOOW!” “PHEW! Thanks!” said Oliver. 
                        “The opposite of slow is . . . FAST, and off he went.” 
                        He caught up to Oscar just as he was crossing the finish line. 
                        “We finished our opposite obstacle course!” Ozzie came oooooozing over and passed out oranges for everyone. 
                        “I loved our opposite obstacle course, but it’s almost nighttime, so I’m getting sleepy,” Oliver said. 
                        “I’m not. Owls don’t sleep at night—we sleep during the day.” “Hey . . . NIGHT, DAY—another opposite!” The End.</p>

                        a queen named Quincy. She loved quilts, but she didn’t really want to buy a quilt. 
                        She wanted to make one ’cuz she was CREATIVE. 
                        So she went on a looong quest to go see Quintin, her friend the porcupine. 
                        If she could borrow one of his quills, she could use it as a needle to make her 
                        quilt! When she finally got to his house, he wasn’t there! Queen Quincy thought 
                        and thought. If Quintin was quietly hiding nearby, she could possibly talk him 
                        into giving her a quill. So, the queen yelled out, 
                        “Quintin, I have a quarter for you if you give me one quill!” 
                        Quintin crept out of his hiding place. He decided he’d 
                        like that quarter for a quill ’cuz he may want to buy something. 
                        Queen Quincy sewed and sewed and sewed with the quill to make a beautiful quilt, 
                        but she hadn’t forgotten what Quintin gave to her. Even though she got her queenly quilt, 
                        she made Quintin his own queenly cozy quilt. So he can quietly snuggle in his own quilt. 
                        So warm and cozy! The End </p>

                        Rosie works at the Red Robot Room at the robot factory. 
                        She is responsible for putting the red robots together. 
                        Just as Rosie was about to grab a red robot leg out of the box, 
                        a racecar ran into the box, turning the whole box of robot legs into rubble! 
                        “Oh no! I can’t use any of these red robot legs!” Randal from the racecar 
                        factory had a remote control for the racecar. Randal ran to the window. 
                        “I’m so sorry Rosie! That racecar must not be ready yet. I’ll have to fix it!” 
                        “Rats,” said Rosie. “I really need red legs!” She radioed her friend Ralph. 
                        “Do you have any red robot legs?” Ralph replied, “I don’t have any red robot legs, but I have blue robot legs.” 
                        That gave Rosie an idea. Rosie raced from room to room picking up different-colored robot parts. 
                        She grabbed yellow arms, a green body, really-long blue legs, and a round orange head. 
                        She took her box of parts back to the red room, ripped a piece of tape, 
                        and wrapped it around the arms to connect it to the body. 
                        She took a step back to admire her robot. It was a . . . RAINBOW ROBOT!!! 
                        “I will call you Robert!” “Meep moop reep roop. I. Am. Robert. 
                        The Rainbow Robot.” Rosie realized she made something really

                        Sally slithered to her woodshop to get spaceship supplies. She scooped up screws and a saw. 
                        Steven skipped to the store to get sandwiches for their trip. They met back up and started making their spaceship. 
                        Sally built the ship and painted it sparkly silver. Steven built seats. 
                        Sally tried to use her screws to attach the seats, but the screws didn’t fit—they kept slipping. 
                        Sally and Steven didn’t know what to do! They needed seats for their spaceship! 
                        They called over to their friend Sam the sloth to help them out, and then he started slinking over sooooo sloooooowly. 
                        While they were waiting for Sam, Sally figured it out. She screamed, “I’ve got it!” and speedily slithered back to her woodshop. 
                        “Oh, silly me!” Sally said. “I took size seven screws, but I needed size six screws!” 
                        Sally slithered back with the size six screws and screwed in the seats. 
                        The spaceship was ready, and ZOOM—blasted off! Sam the sloth arrived just in time to say 
                        “BYYYYYYE!” Steven steered the ship all the way past the sun to a spectacular star, where they ate their scrumptious sandwiches. The End.  </p>

                        “Oh, let me get that. Don’t open the ultimate umbrella until I get back,” his uncle said. 
                        Umberto stood very still in the room with the umbrellas. All of a sudden Umberto felt something in his nose.

                        Yohan the yeti, Yasmine the Yorkshire Terrier, and Yvette the yellow mongoose were ready to present their flavors. 
                        But where was Yolanda the yak? “Yikes!” said Yasmine. “How can we have the yearly yogurt-flavor contest without Yolanda?” 
                        They waited and waited and were about to go home when all of a sudden Yolanda came running into the room, yelling, 
                        “I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m here!” “Where have you been?” Yasmine asked. Yolanda yaaaaawned and said, 
                        “I slept toooo looong. But let’s get this year’s yogurt contest started!” Yohan presented his yam-flavored yogurt. 
                        Yolanda took a big bite. “Yum!” Yasmine gave Yolanda her yucca-flavored yogurt. Yolanda took a big bite. 
                        “Yummy!” And Yvette had a yellow squash–flavored yogurt. Yolanda took a big bite. 
                        “Yumolicious!” “These are all sooooo yummy, but I think that . . . 
                        Yohan and his yam-flavored yogurt was my favorite! Here is my special new yo-yo!” 
                        “Yippie!” yelled Yohan as he gave his new yo-yo a spin. THE END Y! </p>

                    <h3> Z,z </h3>
                    <p class = "examples">Z-e-r-o</p>
                    <p> Here’s a story about the letter Z. You can make uppercase Z like this: a line here, a slanted line down, 
                        and then another line on the bottom. You make lowercase z the same way but smaller: a line here, 
                        a slanted line down, and then a line on the bottom. Some things that start with Z are . . . Zebra Zucchini Zeppelin 
                        Okay, now, here’s our story. Zed the zebra was zigzagging down the road in his zippy car. 
                        He was going to pick up his two zebra cousins, Zamara and Zebbediah, at the zoo. Zed pulled up to the zoo in his zippy car, 
                        where his cousins were waiting. “Hi, Zed! I can’t wait to get to Grandma Zebra’s house for her famous zucchini dinner!” 
                        Zebbediah added, “I think she’s even going to have zeppoles for dessert. MMMMmmmmm.” 
                        So, the zebras all tried to squeeze into Zed’s zippy car. But, it was too small! “We’ll never fit!” said Zamara. 
                        The zookeeper was nearby and said, “Hey, zebra cousins! Are you heading to Grandma Zebra’s for dinner?” 
                        “Yeah, but we don’t fit in Zed’s car.” “Well, as long as you save me some zeppoles, 
                        you can take the zoo’s special zeppelin!” “Whoooohoo! That zeppelin looks like a balloon! And we get to ride in it. 
                        Thanks, Mr. Zookeeper!” said Zed. The zookeeper replied, “No problem! Just use the zipper to get in.” 
                        So the zebra cousins zealously piled into the zookeeper’s zeppelin, and they were on their way. 
                        They landed at Grandma Zebra’s house, where they all enjoyed her famous zucchini dinner—and zeppoles for dessert. THE END Z! </p>
